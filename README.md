2. Create a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis,  
3. Create a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md and  
4. Include a README.md in the repo with your scripts, explaining how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
